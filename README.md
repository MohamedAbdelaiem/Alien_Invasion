# ðŸ‘½ AlienInvasion ðŸ›¸ðŸŒŒ

**AlienInvasion** is an exciting C++ project that simulates an intense war between aliens and humans. The simulation utilizes various advanced data structures to manage armies and their units in a large-scale battle, creating an immersive and strategic experience to determine the final victor.

## Overview

The project models three distinct armies, each with their own objectives:

- **Earth Army**: Defends the planet from extraterrestrial threats.
- **Alien Army**: Invades Earth with hostile forces.
- **Ally Army**: Supports Earth by assisting in the battle against aliens.

The simulation incorporates randomized unit generation for each army to create dynamic and unpredictable battles.
